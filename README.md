# flask_mongo_app
This app uses a mongo database to allow the user to input an event name, date and type. 
The website then displays this data and allows the user to either delete all data or input more. 

In order to use the app, first data is inputed in the input page (type, name and date). This data is then displayed
in the index page. Below the data there are two links to either delete all data or go back to the input page to input
more data. The user can choose either.
